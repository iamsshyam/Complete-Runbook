-i, --inode
    print the index number of each file

-I, --ignore=PATTERN

-r, --reverse
        reverse order while sorting

-R, --recursive
        list subdirectories recursively

cat =  open the file 
cat -b = add number to non-blank line
cat -n = add number to all line 
cat -s = segregating all blankspaces to one 

date = current date 
date +%d = day of month 
date +%a = day of week
date +%b = month 
date +%D = current date
sudo date -s yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss = change the date of system

cal = calendar 

pwd = present working directory 

touch = create blank file & change the timestamps of file created/ modified
touch -a <dateformat> = modify date 

bc =  calculator for all maths 

head =  list the data of file from start
head -10 = only starting 10 lines

tail = list the data from bottom 
tail -10 =only bottom 10 lines 

wc <file-name> = word count of file 
wc -l =  lines of file
wc -c = character of file
wc -w = word of file 

cut = cut out selected portions of each line of a file 

file filename = provides file type [file abc.txt]

network manager 
nmcli

partitions in linux cat /proc/partitions
lsblk = list of block devices
       -a, --all
              Also list empty devices and RAM disk devices.

       -b, -- Print bytes SIZE column in bytes rather
               the  than in a human-readable format.

       -D, --discard
              Print information about the discarding capabilities (TRIM, UNMAP) for each device.

       -d, --nodeps
              Do not print holder devices or slaves.  For example, lsblk --nodeps /dev/sda prints information about the sda device only.

       -E, --dedup column
              Use column as a de-duplication key to de-duplicate output tree. If the key is not available for the device, or the device is a partition and parental whole-disk device provides the  same  key
              than the device is always printed.

              The usual use case is to de-duplicate output on system multi-path devices, for example by -E WWN.

       -e, --exclude list
              Exclude  the devices specified by the comma-separated list of major device numbers.  Note that RAM disks (major=1) are excluded by default if --all is not specified.  The filter is applied to
              the top-level devices only. This may be confusing for --list output format where hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.

       -f, --fs
              Output info about filesystems.  This option is equivalent to -o NAME,FSTYPE,LABEL,UUID,MOUNTPOINT.  The authoritative information about filesystems and raids is provided by the blkid(8)  com‐
              mand.

grep = searches a file with particular pattern [grep ]
   -c : This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
   -h : Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames.
   -i : Ignores, case for matching
   -l : Displays list of a filenames only.
   -n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers.
   -v : This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
   -e exp : Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times.
   -f file : Takes patterns from file, one per line.
   -E : Treats pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE)
   -w : Match whole word
   -o : Print only the matched parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line.
    -A n : Prints searched line and nlines after the result.
    -B n : Prints searched line and n line before the result.
    -C n : Prints searched line and n lines after before the result.
